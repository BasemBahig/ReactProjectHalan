## halanapp
This is the Jobathon Project related to Halan app
# Steps applied in this project:
1- Instal React App 
using how to start document:
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
# M1
Under SRC Create:
 UITable folder
Then Create :
data.json
halantable.jsx
# In data.json
we will create the table components
We will use .map() function to parse each object of  JSON file and return <tr> component with JSON object as table data.

## M2
To print React Table to PDF
npm i react-to-print
add in JSX:
import jspdf from 'jspdf'
faced error after install above 
have been uninstalled then
added
import React, {}  from 'react';
npm run build
then
npm install -g serve

## M3
to handle different input types in React
https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#handling-multiple-inputs

we can create a handleInputChange


## Fix M2
add 
import jsPDF from "jspdf";
import "jspdf-autotable";
and 
install 
npm i jspdf
create file jspdf.umd.min.js
create new file jspdf.plugin.autotable.js

npm i jspdf-autotable
npm install bootstrap --save


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
